    <h5 align="center">This is a plugin whose task is to display the amount of heart of another player.<br>
    The player's heart information is displayed in the chat.<br>
    Currently, the plugin only monitors information by arrows, snowballs and fishing rods.<br>
    We plan to add more variety and stuff to the plugin in later updates.<br><br>
    Let us know about your feelings through our plugin and express your opinion. Thanks!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></h5>
